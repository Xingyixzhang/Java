# Java Inheritance
## Definitions: 
```markdown
A class that is derived from another class is called a **subclass** (also a *derived* class, *extended* class, or *child* class). 
The class from which the subclass is derived is called a **superclass** (also a *base* class or a *parent* class). 

Excepting **Object**, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (**single inheritance**). 
**While C# supports multiple inheritance, Java does NOT.** In the absence of any other explicit superclass, 
every class is implicitly a subclass of Object.

Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on, 
and ultimately derived from the topmost class, Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes 
in the inheritance chain stretching back to Object.
```

> :warning: **NOTE**: A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

## Private Members in a Superclass:
#### 1. A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.

#### 2. A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing classâ€”both fields and methods. Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.

## Examples:
```java
public class Bicycle {
        
    // the Bicycle class has three fields
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
        
    // the Bicycle class has one constructor
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }
        
    // the Bicycle class has four methods
    public void setCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
    }
        
    public void setGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
    }
        
    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
    }
        
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }
        
}

public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
        
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one field
    public int seatHeight;

    // the MountainBike subclass has one constructor
    public MountainBike(int startHeight,
                        int startCadence,
                        int startSpeed,
                        int startGear) {
        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);
        seatHeight = startHeight;
    }   
        
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one method
    public void setHeight(int newValue) {
        seatHeight = newValue;
    }   
}
```
